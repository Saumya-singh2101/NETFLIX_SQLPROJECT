# NETFLIX_SQL_PROJECT

# What I Did
In this project, I performed an exploratory data analysis on a Netflix dataset using SQL. The dataset included details about various TV shows and movies, such as genre, title, director, country, release year, duration, and ratings. My goal was to answer real-world business questions through structured queries and derive insights that could be useful for content strategy, user engagement, and platform analytics.

# How I Did It

Used PostgreSQL functions and SQL queries to clean and analyze data.

Applied aggregations, window functions, string operations, and date conversions to extract insights.

Organized queries around business objectives like most popular genres, top countries contributing content, frequent directors, and content trends.

# Why I Did It
The purpose of this project was to:

Practice and improve my SQL skills on a real-world entertainment dataset.

Learn how to translate business questions into data queries.

Understand content patterns, user preferences, and platform distribution based on actual data.

Simulate how a data analyst or business intelligence role might function in a media/OTT company.

# My Key-Takeaways

Understood how data cleaning and parsing (like splitting and converting text) is crucial before analysis.

Realized the value of SQL in storytelling â€” how simple queries can answer complex business questions.

Improved my ability to write optimized, readable, and logical SQL queries for various use cases.
